    "## Machine Learning Assignment 2 Solutions \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.\tWhat is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Human learning is the process of learning new knowledge, behaviour, skills, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "For ex: When a child runs how to walk, when a human study new things at school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.\tWhat different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Artificial Intelligence Learning Theories. Machine Learning. Reinforcement Learning. Supervised Learning. Unsupervised Learning.\n",
    "- ML equivalents like Linear regression, decision trees, random forest and support vector machines are some commonly used techniques that are actually examples of supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a part of Artifical Intelligance and it basically learns from the data given and predict the future or improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by identifying patterns, learning about them, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Key reponsibilitys:\n",
    "- Removing outliers\n",
    "- test the model after creation it\n",
    "- getting better result\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning can be referred as Agent. When agent does good work he given reward else penalty. Therefore, agent will maximize production and get max rewards and minimize penalty\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a search through the concept description which describes the sentence best\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals of ml are to analysis patterns in the data and give or predict the best possible result, also help's in solving the problems\n",
    "\n",
    "The relation b/w ml and human learning is that human learns from experience or shared by someone and ml learns from the past data provided to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data\n",
    "- Model\n",
    "- Loss Function\n",
    "- Learning Algorithm\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "- Maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "\n",
    "class A():\n",
    "\n",
    "    def a(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "        \n",
    "class B(A):\n",
    "\n",
    "    def a(self):\n",
    "        print('here')\n",
    "\n",
    "B().a()\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generalization refers to your model's ability to adapt properly to new, previously unseen data, drawn from the same distribution as the one used to create the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data.This issue can result to classify an actual dog image as a cat from the unseen dataset. Therefore, data diversity is very important factor in order to make a good prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification is supervised machine learning and it predicts the categorial/discrete output only while regression predicts the result in continous.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression is a Supervised machine learning and it predicts the continuous output. There are 3 main metrics for regression, variance, error and bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real world ex:\n",
    "- Predicting the value of house\n",
    "- Stock market prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster mecahnism is when the population data is divided into groups and those groups are created based on nearer to the data points. So, data points closer to one another will form 1 group and other will form another group.\n"
