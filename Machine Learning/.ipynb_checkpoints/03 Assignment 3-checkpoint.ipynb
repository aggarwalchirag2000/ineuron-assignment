    "## Machine Learning Assignment 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Explain the term machine learning, and how does it work? Explain two machine learning applications in the business world. What are some of the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a part of Artifical Intelligance and it basically learns from the data given and predict the future or improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "It works by identifying patterns, learning about them, etc\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications example: Fraud detection, Customer recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "ethical concern: Cost of innovation, lack of quality data, disapperance of jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Describe the process of human learning: \n",
    "#### i. Under the supervision of experts\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-guided machine learning is a process whereby subject matter experts accelerate the learning process by teaching the technology in real-time. For example, if the machine learning model comes across a piece of data it is uncertain about, a human can be asked to weigh in and give feedback. The model then learns from this input, and uses it to make a more accurate prediction the next time. Human-guided machine learning works from the bottom up by first using algorithms to conduct the heavy lifting of identifying relationships within the data, and engaging humans when necessary for training or validation Concept Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ii. With the assistance of experts in an indirect manner\n",
    "\n",
    "Well The process of an algorithm learning from the training dataset can be thought of as a teacher supervising the learning process. We know the correct answers, the algorithm iteratively makes predictions on the training data and is corrected by the teacher. Learning stops when the algorithm achieves an acceptable level of performance Operant Conditioning.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### iii. Self-education\n",
    "\n",
    "Ability to recognize patterns, learn from data, and become more intelligent over time (can be AI or programmatically based).Machine Learning: AI systems with ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed via training Hebbian Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Provide a few examples of various types of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Examine the various forms of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Supervised learning: Fraud detection, Medical diagnosis, speech recognition\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning: Network analysis, recommendation system, anamoly detection\n",
    "- Reinforcement learning: Video games, robotics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Can you explain what a well-posed learning problem is? Explain the main characteristics that must be present to identify a learning problem properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer program is said to learn from experience E in context to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as was measured by P, upgrades with experience E.Any problem can be segregated as well-posed learning problem if it has three traits â€“ Task, Performance and Experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Is machine learning capable of solving all problems? Give a detailed explanation of your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "ML can solve mostly all problems only if issues like this doesn't occur:\n",
    "- Lack of data: If the dataset if very low then the machine can't identify the pattern because of which ml can't predict the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. What are the various methods and technologies for solving machine learning problems? Any two of them should be defined in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scrikt learn(Sklearn): It is most used and helpful library in python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, Regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python\n",
    "- Keras: Keras is used for creating deep models which can be productized on smartphones. Keras is also used for distributed training of deep learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Can you explain the various forms of supervised learning? Explain each one with an example application.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regression: In regression, a single output value is produced using training data.For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc.\n",
    "- Classification: It involves grouping the data into classes.eg. If you are thinking of extending credit to a person, you can use classification to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter.\n",
    "- Naive Bayesian Model: The Bayesian model of classification is used for large finite datasets. It is a method of assigning class labels using a direct acyclic graph.\n",
    "- Decision Trees: A decision tree is a flowchart-like model that contains conditional control statements, comprising decisions and their probable consequences. The output relates to the labelling of unforeseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? With a sample application in each region, explain the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised Learning both label and feature attributes are provides. It is done for classification or regression problem while in unsupervised only label attributes are given and prediction happens on that only. It is done for clustering of the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Describe the machine learning process in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps to create a machine learning model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Data collection: Data is collection through research or data is found on online platform as well like on kaggle. Data can be purchased as well\n",
    "2) Data Prepartion: After collection the data is prepared for training. In this all the same rows, or null values are remove or outliers are removed and EDA happens at this state.\n",
    "3) Choose a mode: There are different algorithm's present so one is choosed among all the algorithm.\n",
    "4) Train the data set: Training in which machine analysis the pattern happens at this stage.\n",
    "5) Evaluate the mode: The model accurary score is tested.\n",
    "6) Parameter tuning: or also called hyperparameter tuning. In this parameters are given different values so that better accurary can be given a model.\n",
    "7) Make predictions: Using the test dataset, predictions are taken place so that programmers can test out how it would be in real world."
